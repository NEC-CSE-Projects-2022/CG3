## Features Used

- **Feature 1:**  
  pH – Indicates the acidity or alkalinity of water

- **Feature 2:**  
  Turbidity – Measures water clarity and the presence of suspended particles

- **Feature 3:**  
  Chloramines – Represents chemical disinfectants affecting water safety

*(Additional features include solids, electrical conductivity, sulfate, and organic carbon.)*
